This is an lightweight implementation of NDIâ„¢ plugin for Unity macOS and iOS.

This plugin has some limitation compared to the [full implementation] of the
plugin.

- It only supports sender functionalities. It can't be a receiver.
- The camera capture mode is dropped. It has to be used with a render texture.
